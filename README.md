## TITLE

- RECIPE RANDOMZIER 

## DESCRIPTION 

- This project allows you to enter any caloric value and it will return a list of recipes that fall under the given caloric input. The list of items will change or stay the same from the previous list depending on the calories input. 

## INSTALLATION 

- Fork this repository to your local machine. After forking, click on the green CODE button on GitHub and copy the SSH key. 

- Open your terminal and navigate into your desired folder. Then, type `git clone`, paste the SSH key next the command, and hit enter. It should now be cloned to your local machine. 

- Type `code .` to open the directory in VSCode. No dependencies are needed for this project as passing tests is not required. 

- All code files should be visible and ready to have changes made. 

## SAVING YOUR WORK REMOTELY 

- Any work done on the project is still only on the local machine so it would need to be added, committed, and pushed to the remote repository on GitHub. 

- Use the following commands to do so: 

`git add .`
`git commit -m "Completed Assignment"`
`git push`

## FUTURE FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY 

- This project is as bare bones as it can get. Possible features to be added in the future include links to the posted recipes. An area to save your favorite recipes. Perhaps an interchangeability functionality that allows you to alter certain parts of recipe to suit your dietary needs, wants, and/or restrictions.
